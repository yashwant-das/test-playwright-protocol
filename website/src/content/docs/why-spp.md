title: Why SPP?
description: Understand the motivation behind the Smart Playwright Protocol.

Smart Playwright Protocol (SPP) was born out of a simple observation: **Unstructured AI coding leads to technical debt.**

### The Problem: Ad-hoc AI Workflows

Most teams using AI for automation follow a "Hope-Driven" workflow:

1. **Prompt**: "Write me a Playwright test for login."
2. **Code**: AI generates a single file with hardcoded selectors.
3. **Hope**: The user runs the test, it passes once, and they commit it.

This approach fails at scale. Selectors break, code becomes unmaintainable, and there's no record of what was actually verified.

### The SPP Solution: Verification-First

SPP replaces hope with a disciplined lifecycle.

| Generic AI Workflow | SPP Workflow |
| :--- | :--- |
| Prompt → Code → **Hope** | Task → Protocol → Verification → **Done** |

### Why Verification Matters

In SPP, a task is **never** done just because the code was written. It is only done when the **Verification Gate** passes. This gate enforces:
- **Linting**: No sloppy code.
- **Repository Standards**: Page Objects, no raw locators.
- **Functional Correctness**: The actual Playwright test passes.

### Why Task States Matter

By forcing tasks through states (`TODO` → `IN_PROGRESS` → `DONE` or `BLOCKED`), SPP creates a clear audit trail. You can look at any task file and see exactly what the AI was supposed to do, what it understood, and how it was verified.

### Why Recovery Exists

AI fails often. Instead of getting stuck in a loop of "Try again," SPP uses the `BLOCKED` state. When verification fails, the CLI generates a **Repair Prompt** containing the specific logs and errors. This allows the AI to recover with evidence rather than guesswork.

### Simple Over Complex

SPP intentionally avoids complex "Agent Orchestration" or "Self-Healing" architectures. It relies on a simple CLI and human-readable files. This keeps the framework lightweight, easy to debug, and 100% predictable.

:::note[Core Takeaway]
SPP isn't about making the AI smarter; it's about making the **process** robust enough to handle AI-generated code safely.
